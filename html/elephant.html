                    <h4>ELEPHANTS</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the 
                            Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, 
                            the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant 
                            (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan 
                            Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are 
                            the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 
                            4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable 
                            of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, 
                            particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. 
                            Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons 
                            and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large 
                            ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like 
                            legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger 
                            ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and 
                            convex or level backs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats 
                            including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to 
                            stay near water.
